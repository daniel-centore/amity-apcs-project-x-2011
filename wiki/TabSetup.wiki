==Command Line==
  * If you use a modern `vi`, just make sure you `:set modeline` in your `.exrc`. The source files have appropriate modelines.
  * No spaces before function parentheses.
  * Use comment and brace style as in `trunk/src/org/amityregion5/Template.java`.
    * The newline after the `class` declaration is optional and harmless.
  * Use a 4-space tab stop for indentation.
  * Use template located at org.amityregion5.Template
